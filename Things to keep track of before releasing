The database folder has been chosen to be 'C:\sqlite\db\pythonsqlite.db' , I created this folder manually
for this version but it will give an error if the folder 'C:\sqlite\db' did not exist or created manually.

So far I am only collecting retweeters of first 10 Tweets of large celebrities to get the best seed profiles. It
has to be done in a better way.
